# 🧬 DNA String Manipulation (Intermediate Level)

A **C++ program** that provides basic operations on DNA strings, including **GC content calculation** and **pattern searching** using the **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm**.  

---

## ✨ Features
- **GC Content Calculation** – Counts the number of `G` and `C` bases in a DNA string  
- **Pattern Matching** – Uses the **KMP algorithm** for efficient substring searching  
- **Example Provided** – Works on the sample DNA string `AGCTGCGCAGCT`  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++17  

---

## 🚀 Setup & Installation
1. Ensure `g++` is installed:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install g++
   ```
2. Save the code as `dna.cpp`

### ▶️ How to Compile & Run
```bash
g++ dna.cpp -o dna
./dna
```

---

## 🎯 Usage
1. Modify the DNA string in `main()` to test other sequences
2. Change the pattern in `kmp_search` to find different subsequences
